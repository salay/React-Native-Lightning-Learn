React Native is an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook. It is used to develop applications for Android, iOS and UWP by enabling developers to use React along with native platform capabilities. Works on both iOS and Android.

### Build native mobile apps using JavaScript and React

React Native lets you build mobile apps using only JavaScript. It uses the same design as React, letting you compose a rich mobile UI using declarative components. For example instead of using 'div' and 'span', you can use 'Text' and 'View'.

### A React Native app is a real mobile app

The apps you are building with React Native aren't mobile web apps because React Native uses the same fundamental UI building blocks as regular iOS and Android apps. Instead of using Swift, Kotlin or Java, you are putting those building blocks together using JavaScript and React.React Native lets you build your app faster. Instead of recompiling, you can reload your app instantly. With Hot Reloading, you can even run new code while retaining your application state. Give it a try - it's a magical experience.
